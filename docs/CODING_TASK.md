Build a Server for a Notes App

Here are the specs:

- Build a server using Node.js

- You should be able to return all notes.

- You should be able to add one or more notes.

- You should be able to edit a note.

- You should be able to delete one or more notes.

- You should be able to search notes.

- The notes should be persisted and retrieved via the service.

Stretch Goals:

You do not need to implement these, unless you want to and have the

time. Just think about how you would go about implementing them and we'll walk through it in the in person interview.

- Input Validation

- Unit testing

- Front-end

- Documentation

Parameters:

- Use Postman, Curl or your favorite tool. You do not need to build a front end, unless you have time.

- For frameworks (or lack there of), use what you're familiar with but if you don't have a favorite, Koa, Express, Hapi, or the Node.js HTTP Server are all great options.

- Persistence: A JSON file is fine, this doesn't need to be a distributed app. Lowdb is a great library for just this. If you know lodash/underscore, you know lowdb. If you'd rather something else, great. Just make sure the project is self-contained so we can run it.

- Source Control: We need to review and run your app, so please create a repo on Github Don't have a Github account? It's free to join.

Do's and Dont's

- Do go with what you know. You don't need to use the latest and greatest.

- Do add a readme with instructions to run.

- Do read docs and use the vast resources of the internet. We don't expect you to know everything, but you should know where to find it.

- Do let us know if you have any questions, problems or feedback. If you have any question, please reach out to Paul Bartlett paul.bartlett@walmartlabs.com.

- Don't worry about polish. Make it useable, but don't worry about styling.

- Don't over engineer it. We don't need authentication, logging or minification.
